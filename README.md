# BSDS Website

A preview of the web page can be seen at <https://bsds-isi.github.io/>

To generate a local copy, [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is required. 

* Check out the repository from <https://github.com/bsds-isi/bsds-isi.github.io/>

* Run `jekyll build -s . -d static`

This should create a pure HTML version of the website in `static/`, which can be copied over to another server hosting the website if necessary.
